# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

#Generic files to ignore
.~*
*.DS_Store
*.swp
*.out
*.log
.lock

#Files generated by programming tools
nbproject/*
.idea/*
.vagrant*
.project
.loadpath
node_modules
