## About The Project

This project is a turn-based, multiplayer game created to introduce basic text-based programming concepts in an engaging format.
The game can be played with up to 4 players.

Your mission is to collect as many items as possible by controlling your animals using code. 
The stage ends once all items have been taken or every player reaches the maximum turn limit. 
After the stage concludes, the final scores are compared to determine the winner.

This game was developed as part of my dissertation research. A link to the associated academic publication will be provided once it is available.
